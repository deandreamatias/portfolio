## About the project

I made this portfolio to experiment with Flutter web and have a place to share the references link to my podcast.

This project has been built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework, which allows to build an app for mobile, desktop & web, from a single codebase.

## Build and run

First, clone the repository with the 'git clone' command, or just download the zip.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:deandreamatias/portfolio.git
```

Then, download either Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, with their respective [Flutter editor plugins](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor). For more information about Flutter installation procedure, check the [official install guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Install dependencies from pubspec.yaml by running `flutter packages get` from the project root (see [using packages documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app) for details and how to do this in the editor).

Run in debug mode :)
